title: Enable Google Classroom in Google Workspace
description: Configure Google Cloud, OAuth, and Workspace settings so teachers and students can connect Type the Word.
---

## Overview

This guide is for Google Workspace admins and technical owners. It prepares your domain so users can connect from `/classroom` using:

- Teacher OAuth callback: `/api/classroom/callback`
- Student OAuth callback: `/api/classroom/student-callback`

## Prerequisites

- Workspace admin access for your school domain
- Access to Google Cloud Console for your integration project
- Your app domain (for example `https://typetheword.site` or your self-hosted URL)
- The following environment variables configured in Type the Word:
    - `GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_CLIENT_ID`
    - `GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_CLIENT_SECRET`

## Step 1: Create or select a Google Cloud project

1. Open Google Cloud Console.
2. Create a new project or select an existing one used for this integration.
3. Make sure billing and org policy do not block Classroom API usage.

## Step 2: Enable Google Classroom API

1. In Google Cloud, go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
2. Search for **Google Classroom API**.
3. Click **Enable**.

- Caption: `Enable the Google Classroom API in the same project as your OAuth client.`

## Step 3: Configure OAuth consent screen

1. Go to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
2. Choose **Internal** if only your Workspace users should connect, or **External** if required.
3. Fill app name, support email, and authorized domain.
4. Add required scopes for both teacher and student flows.

Teacher scopes used by Type the Word:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.students`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.rosters.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.student-submissions.students.readonly`

Student scopes used by Type the Word:

- `openid`
- `email`
- `profile`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.courses.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/classroom.coursework.me`

## Step 4: Create OAuth 2.0 Web credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
2. Click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.
3. Choose **Web application**.
4. Add authorized redirect URIs:
    - `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/classroom/callback`
    - `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/classroom/student-callback`
5. Save and copy the generated Client ID and Client Secret.

- Caption: `Both teacher and student callback URLs must be present.`

## Step 5: Configure Type the Word environment variables

1. Set `GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_CLIENT_ID` to your OAuth Client ID.
2. Set `GOOGLE_CLASSROOM_CLIENT_SECRET` to your OAuth Client Secret.
3. Restart the app deployment.

- Caption: `Use the same OAuth client created in your Google Cloud project.`

## Step 6: Validate teacher and student OAuth flows

1. Sign in to Type the Word.
2. Open `/classroom`.
3. Confirm **Connect as Teacher** starts Google OAuth and returns to `/classroom?success=true`.
4. Confirm **Connect as Student** starts Google OAuth and returns to `/classroom?student_success=true`.

- Alt text: `Type the Word classroom page with teacher and student connect actions`
- Caption: `Use this page to validate both OAuth flows after setup.`

## Troubleshooting

- **Redirect URI mismatch:** Verify callback URLs exactly match your deployed domain and path.
- **App blocked or unverified:** Complete consent screen publishing and domain verification where required.
- **Access denied for users:** Confirm app user type (Internal vs External) and Workspace restrictions.
- **Teacher connects but cannot create assignments:** Confirm teacher scopes include coursework and rosters scopes.
- **Student cannot submit assignments:** Confirm student scope includes `classroom.coursework.me`.
