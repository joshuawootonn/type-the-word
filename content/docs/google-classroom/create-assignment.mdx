## Overview

Teachers create assignments from [`/classroom/assign`](/classroom/assign). The app creates Google Classroom coursework in **Draft** first, then you publish it.

## Prerequisites

- Teacher account connected on [`/classroom`](/classroom)
- At least one Google Classroom course
- Passage details ready (translation, book, chapter, verse range)

## Step 1: Open the assignment form

1. Go to [`/classroom/assign`](/classroom/assign).
2. Confirm the page title is **Create Assignment**.

- Caption: `All required assignment inputs are on one page.`

## Step 2: Fill course and passage details

1. Choose a **Course**.
2. In **Passage**, select:
    - **Translation**
    - **Book**
    - **Start Chapter** and **Start Verse**
    - **End Chapter** and **End Verse**

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot open create form:** Reconnect teacher account on [`/classroom`](/classroom).
- **Course dropdown is empty:** Verify you teach at least one course in Google Classroom.
- **Assignment creation fails:** Check OAuth scopes for coursework students and rosters.
- **Students cannot see assignment:** Ensure the assignment is published, not draft.
- **Verse range issues:** Use a same-chapter range to avoid unsupported multi-chapter behavior.
