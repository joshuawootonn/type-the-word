## Overview

Students complete assignments from [`/classroom/{courseId}/assignment/{assignmentId}`](/classroom/dashboard). Progress is tracked while typing, then submitted using **Turn in assignment**.

## Prerequisites

- Student account connected on [`/classroom`](/classroom)
- Assignment is published by your teacher
- You are enrolled in the class with the same Google account used to connect

## Step 1: Open dashboard and choose your course

1. Go to [`/classroom/dashboard`](/classroom/dashboard).
2. Select the course where your assignment was posted.

3. Click the assignment you need to complete.

Open the assignment detail page from your course list.

## Step 3: Review assignment details and start typing

On the assignment page, confirm:

- Assignment title and passage reference
- Completion meter and verse count
- Typing area for the assigned passage

Progress updates as you complete verses in this page.

## Step 4: Complete all assigned verses

1. Type each verse accurately.
2. Track **Average WPM** and **Accuracy**.
3. Continue until completion shows all verses done.

You must complete all required verses before turning in.

## Step 5: Turn in the assignment

1. Click **Turn in assignment**.
2. Wait for confirmation:
    - **Nice work! Assignment completed.**
    - **This assignment is turned in.**

Turn in sends your completion result back to Google Classroom.

## Step 6: Confirm submission status

Return to your course assignment list and verify the assignment appears completed.

Completed status confirms your assignment workflow is done.

## Troubleshooting

- **Turn in button disabled or missing:** Complete all verses first.
- **Not enrolled message:** Sign in with the Google account enrolled in that class.
- **Cannot submit despite completion:** Reconnect student account and retry.
- **Assignment not found:** Confirm teacher provided the correct course and assignment.
- **Multi-chapter assignment warning:** This assignment type is not supported yet.
