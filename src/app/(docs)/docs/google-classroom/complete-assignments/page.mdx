## Step 1: Open the assignment from dashboard

2. Open your course.
3. Click the assignment you need to complete.

## Troubleshooting

- **Turn in button disabled or missing:** Complete all verses first.
- **Not enrolled message:** Sign in with the Google account enrolled in that class.
- **Cannot submit despite completion:** Reconnect student account and retry.
- **Assignment not found:** Confirm teacher provided the correct course and assignment.
- **Multi-chapter assignment warning:** This assignment type is not supported yet.
