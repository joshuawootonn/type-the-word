## What this integration does

Type the Word integrates with Google Classroom so teachers can create typing assignments from passages and students can complete them in the app.

At a high level:

- Admins enable and approve the Google Workspace app configuration.
- Teachers connect their Google account and create assignments.
- Students connect their account, complete assignments, and turn them in.

These docs are very work-in-progress. Some more info will be provided soon.
