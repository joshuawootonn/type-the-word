## Overview

Teacher progression tracking is available in two places:

- Course-level assignment list on [`/classroom/{courseId}`](/classroom/dashboard)
- Assignment-level student detail on [`/classroom/{courseId}/assignment/{assignmentId}`](/classroom/dashboard)

## Prerequisites

- Teacher account connected
- At least one assignment created
- Students have started or completed typed verses

## Step 1: Open your dashboard and choose a course

1. Go to [`/classroom/dashboard`](/classroom/dashboard).
2. Select the course you want to monitor.

Start tracking by opening a specific course.

## Step 2: Review assignment-level stats in the course view

On [`/classroom/{courseId}`](/classroom/dashboard), review each assignment card:

- Completion ratio (`completedCount / submissionCount`)
- Average completion percentage
- Status indicators (for example Draft or Published)

Use the course view for quick class-wide progress scanning.

## Step 3: Open one assignment for student details

1. Click the assignment to open [`/classroom/{courseId}/assignment/{assignmentId}`](/classroom/dashboard).
2. Review per-student progression data, including:
    - Completed verses
    - Completion percentage
    - Average WPM
    - Average accuracy
    - Started and completed times

Assignment detail view gives student-by-student progression insights.

## Step 4: Identify students needing support

Use assignment detail to find:

- Students with low completion percentage
- Students with low average accuracy
- Students with no started activity

Then follow up in Classroom or class communication channels.

Use completion, WPM, and accuracy together for targeted support.

## Step 5: Publish drafts when needed

If students cannot access an assignment, verify it is **Published** (not Draft).

Publishing is required before students can complete coursework.

## Troubleshooting

- **No student stats appear:** Confirm students opened and worked on the assignment.
- **Progress is lower than expected:** Ensure students are typing within the assignment link, not outside it.
- **Wrong course data:** Recheck you opened the correct `courseId`.
- **Student missing from list:** Student may not be enrolled in the Google Classroom course.
