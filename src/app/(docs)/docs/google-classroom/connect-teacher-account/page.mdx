## Overview

This guide shows teachers how to connect Google Classroom to Type the Word.

Once connected, you can:

- See your classes on [`/classroom/dashboard`](/classroom/dashboard)
- Create assignments from [`/classroom/assign`](/classroom/assign)
- Track assignment progress for your students

## Prerequisites

- You can sign in to Type the Word
- Your school admin completed Workspace setup
- You are a teacher in at least one Google Classroom course

## Step 1: Start from the Classroom page

1. Sign in to Type the Word.
2. Open [`/classroom`](/classroom).
3. In **Teacher Connection**, click **Connect as Teacher**.

This button starts the Google sign-in and permission flow.

## Step 2: Choose your Google account

1. On the Google sign-in page, choose the account you use to teach your classes.
2. If needed, click **Use another account** and sign in with the correct one.

Choose the same account that appears as a teacher in your Google Classroom courses.

## Step 3: Review and allow permissions

1. Review the permissions screen.
2. Click **Allow** to continue.

Google lists exactly what Type the Word can access. These permissions are used to support teacher workflows inside Type the Word.

## What these permissions allow in Type the Word

On the consent screen, Google shows four Classroom permissions. Here is what each one means in plain language:

- **Manage coursework and grades for students in classes you teach/administer**  
  Lets Type the Word create and update assignments in your classes.
- **View coursework and grades for students in classes you teach/administer**  
  Lets Type the Word show assignment details and progress when you review class work.
- **View your Google Classroom class rosters**  
  Lets Type the Word identify students in your classes for assignment tracking.
- **View your Google Classroom classes**  
  Lets Type the Word load your course list so you can pick a class when creating assignments.

## Step 4: Confirm connected state in Type the Word

After redirect, you should return to [`/classroom`](/classroom) and see:

- **Connected as teacher**
- Buttons for **Create assignment** and **View dashboard**
- A **Disconnect from Google Classroom** button

If this card appears, your teacher account is connected successfully.

## Step 5: Verify your classes load

1. Click **View dashboard**.
2. Confirm your classes appear on [`/classroom/dashboard`](/classroom/dashboard).
3. Open one class to verify you can view assignments and student progress.

If your classes appear, your connection is working.

## Disconnecting your teacher account

1. Return to [`/classroom`](/classroom).
2. In **Teacher Connection**, click **Disconnect from Google Classroom**.
3. Refresh and confirm **Connect as Teacher** appears again.

## Troubleshooting

- **No courses on dashboard:** Verify you selected the correct Google account and that it has teacher access.
- **OAuth finishes but still not connected:** Clear browser cookies, reload [`/classroom`](/classroom), and reconnect.
- **Classroom nav link not visible:** Teacher dashboard visibility depends on active teacher connection cookie.
- **Permission denied errors:** Ask admin to verify the Classroom API and OAuth scopes.
