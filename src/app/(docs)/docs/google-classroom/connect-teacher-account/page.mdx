## Overview

Teachers connect their Google account from [`/classroom`](/classroom). A successful teacher connection enables:

- Course loading on [`/classroom/dashboard`](/classroom/dashboard)
- Assignment creation on [`/classroom/assign`](/classroom/assign)
- Progress tracking on course and assignment detail pages

## Prerequisites

- You can sign in to Type the Word
- Your school admin completed Workspace setup
- You are a teacher in at least one Google Classroom course

## Step 1: Open the Classroom connection page

1. Sign in to Type the Word.
2. Open [`/classroom`](/classroom).
3. Find the **Teacher Connection** section.

## Step 2: Start OAuth with Google

1. Click **Connect as Teacher**.
2. Choose the Google account that owns or teaches your classes.
3. Review and approve requested permissions.

## Step 4: Verify your courses load

1. Click **View dashboard**.
2. Confirm your classes appear on [`/classroom/dashboard`](/classroom/dashboard).
3. Open one course to verify assignment list access.

## Disconnecting your teacher account

1. Return to [`/classroom`](/classroom).
2. In **Teacher Connection**, click **Disconnect from Google Classroom**.
3. Refresh and confirm **Connect as Teacher** appears again.

## Troubleshooting

- **No courses on dashboard:** Verify you selected the correct Google account and that it has teacher access.
- **OAuth finishes but still not connected:** Clear browser cookies, reload [`/classroom`](/classroom), and reconnect.
- **Classroom nav link not visible:** Teacher dashboard visibility depends on active teacher connection cookie.
- **Permission denied errors:** Ask admin to verify the Classroom API and OAuth scopes.
