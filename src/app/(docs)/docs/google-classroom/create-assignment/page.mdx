## Overview

Teachers create assignments from [`/classroom/assign`](/classroom/assign). The app creates Google Classroom coursework in **Draft** first, then you publish it.

## Prerequisites

- Teacher account connected on [`/classroom`](/classroom)
- At least one Google Classroom course
- Passage details ready (translation, book, chapter, verse range)

## Step 1: Open assignment creation from Classroom

You can start assignment creation from two places:

1. From the teacher connection card on [`/classroom`](/classroom)
2. From the specific course page (`/classroom/{courseId}`)

Use whichever entry point is most convenient for your workflow.

## Step 2: Fill the create assignment form

1. Choose a **Course**.
2. In **Passage**, select:
    - **Translation**
    - **Book**
    - **Start Chapter** and **Start Verse**
    - **End Chapter** and **End Verse**

3. Enter **Assignment Title**.
4. Optionally add **Description (optional)**.
5. Set **Max Points**.
6. Optionally set **Due Date (optional)**.

Important: multi-chapter assignments are not supported in student completion. Keep passage within one chapter.

## Step 3: Submit and review draft

1. Click **Create Assignment**.
2. Wait for redirect to [`/classroom/{courseId}/assignment/{assignmentId}`](/classroom/dashboard).
3. Confirm assignment state shows **Draft**.

New assignments are created as draft coursework in Google Classroom.

## Step 4: Publish the assignment

1. On the assignment detail page, click **Publish Assignment** (or **Publish** from course list).
2. Confirm status changes from **Draft** to **Published**.

Students only receive assignments after publish.

## Troubleshooting

- **Cannot open create form:** Reconnect teacher account on [`/classroom`](/classroom).
- **Course dropdown is empty:** Verify you teach at least one course in Google Classroom.
- **Assignment creation fails:** Check OAuth scopes for coursework students and rosters.
- **Students cannot see assignment:** Ensure the assignment is published, not draft.
- **Verse range issues:** Use a same-chapter range to avoid unsupported multi-chapter behavior.
