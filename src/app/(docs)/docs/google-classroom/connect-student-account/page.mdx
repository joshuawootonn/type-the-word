## Overview

## Step 1: Open the connection page

3. Find the **Student Connection** section.

1. Return to [`/classroom`](/classroom).

3. Confirm **Connect as Student** returns.

## Troubleshooting

- **No courses appear:** You may be connected with the wrong Google account.
- **Cannot start assignments:** Confirm your teacher has published the assignment.
- **Not enrolled errors:** Ask teacher to verify your enrollment in Classroom.
- **Prompt says connect student account first:** Reconnect on [`/classroom`](/classroom) and retry.
