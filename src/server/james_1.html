  gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001006-1">6&nbsp;</b>But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for
  the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001007-1">7&nbsp;</b>For that person must not suppose that he will
  receive anything from the Lord; <b class="verse-num" id="v59001008-1">8&nbsp;</b>he is a

  those who love him. <b class="verse-num" id="v59001013-1">13&nbsp;</b>Let no one say when he is
  tempted, “I am being tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts

  lured and enticed by his own desire. <b class="verse-num" id="v59001015-1">15&nbsp;</b>Then desire
  when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.

  be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;
  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001020-1">20&nbsp;</b>for the anger of man does not produce the
  righteousness of God. <b class="verse-num" id="v59001021-1">21&nbsp;</b>Therefore put away all
  filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to
  save your souls.

  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001022-1">22&nbsp;</b>But be doers of the word, and not hearers only,
  deceiving yourselves. <b class="verse-num" id="v59001023-1">23&nbsp;</b>For if anyone is a hearer
  of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001024-1">24&nbsp;</b>For he looks at himself and goes away and at
  once forgets what he was like. <b class="verse-num" id="v59001025-1">25&nbsp;</b>But the one who
  looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a
  doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001026-1">26&nbsp;</b>If anyone thinks he is religious and does not
  bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is worthless.
  <b class="verse-num" id="v59001027-1">27&nbsp;</b>Religion that is pure and undefiled before God
  the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained
  from the world.
