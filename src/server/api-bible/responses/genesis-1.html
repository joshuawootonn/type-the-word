    <span data-number="1" data-sid="GEN 1:1" class="v">1</span>In the beginning
    God created the heavens and the earth.

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="m">
    <span data-number="2" data-sid="GEN 1:2" class="v">2</span>Now the earth was
    formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the

<p class="s2">The First Day</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="pmo">
    <span data-number="3" data-sid="GEN 1:3" class="v">3</span>And God said,

    <span data-number="5" data-sid="GEN 1:5" class="v">5</span>God called the
    light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.”

<p data-vid="GEN 1:5" class="pmo">

    <span data-number="6" data-sid="GEN 1:6" class="v">6</span>And God said,
    “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the
    waters.” <span data-number="7" data-sid="GEN 1:7" class="v">7</span>So God
    made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above.

    <span data-number="10" data-sid="GEN 1:10" class="v">10</span>God called the

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="pmo">
    <span data-number="11" data-sid="GEN 1:11" class="v">11</span>Then God said,

    <span data-number="12" data-sid="GEN 1:12" class="v">12</span>The earth

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="pmo">
    <span data-number="16" data-sid="GEN 1:16" class="v">16</span>God made two

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="pmo">
    <span data-number="17" data-sid="GEN 1:17" class="v">17</span>God set these

    <span data-number="18" data-sid="GEN 1:18" class="v">18</span>to preside
    over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And
    God saw that it was good.

<p class="pmo">
    <span data-number="19" data-sid="GEN 1:19" class="v">19</span>And there was

    <span data-number="21" data-sid="GEN 1:21" class="v">21</span>So God created
    the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the
    waters teemed according to their kinds, and every bird of flight after its
    kind. And God saw that it was good.

<p class="b"></p>
<p class="pmo">
    <span data-number="22" data-sid="GEN 1:22" class="v">22</span>Then God

</p>
<p class="b"></p>
<p class="q1">
