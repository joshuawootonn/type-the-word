    David roots him in history; his unique identity as Son of God was shown by the Spirit when Jesus
    was raised from the dead, setting him apart as the Messiah, our Master. Through him we received
    both the generous gift of his life and the urgent task of passing it on to others who receive it
    by entering into obedient trust in Jesus. You are who you are through this gift and call of
    Jesus Christ! And I greet you now with all the generosity of God our Father and our Master
    Jesus, the Messiah.</span

    think of you in my prayers, which is practically all the time, I ask him to clear the way for me
    to come and see you. The longer this waiting goes on, the deeper the ache. I so want to be there

    >But God’s angry displeasure erupts as acts of human mistrust and wrongdoing and lying
    accumulate, as people try to put a shroud over truth. But the basic reality of God is plain
    enough. Open your eyes and there it is! By taking a long and thoughtful look at what God has
    created, people have always been able to see what their eyes as such can’t see: eternal power,
    for instance, and the mystery of his divine being. So nobody has a good excuse. What happened
    was this: People knew God perfectly well, but when they didn’t treat him like God, refusing to
    worship him, they trivialized themselves into silliness and confusion so that there was neither
    sense nor direction left in their lives. They pretended to know it all, but were illiterate
    regarding life. They traded the glory of God who holds the whole world in his hands for cheap
    figurines you can buy at any roadside stand.</span
