    cleared the air, freeing you from a fated lifetime of brutal tyranny at the hands of sin and

    the disordered mess of struggling humanity in order to set it right once and for all. The law

    >Those who think they can do it on their own end up obsessed with measuring their own moral
    muscle but never get around to exercising it in real life. Those who trust God’s action in them
    find that God’s Spirit is in them—living and breathing God! Obsession with self in these matters
    is a dead end; attention to God leads us out into the open, into a spacious, free life. Focusing
    on the self is the opposite of focusing on God. Anyone completely absorbed in self ignores God,
    ends up thinking more about self than God. That person ignores who God is and what he is doing.
    And God isn’t pleased at being ignored.</span

    God, the Spirit of Christ, won’t know what we’re talking about. But for you who welcome him, in
    whom he dwells—even though you still experience all the limitations of sin—you yourself
    experience life on God’s terms. It stands to reason, doesn’t it, that if the alive-and-present
    God who raised Jesus from the dead moves into your life, he’ll do the same thing in you that he
    did in Jesus, bringing you alive to himself? When God lives and breathes in you (and he does, as
    surely as he did in Jesus), you are delivered from that dead life. With his Spirit living in
    you, your body will be as alive as Christ’s!</span
