  A couple of years ago, I typed out Psalms 1 to 137 over                     a 6 month period. Not only did this improve my typing,
                        but it also encouraged me daily. When I later discovered 
                        <a
                            href="https://monkeytype.com"
                        >
                            monkey type
                        </a>
                        , it made sense to combine the two ideas. Typing the
                        Bible makes you look at every word and see the passage
                        anew. When I was developing this site, I used 
                        <a
                            href="https://typetheword.site/passage/john_11:34-36"
                        >
                            John 11:35
                        </a>
                        as the edgecase since its the shortest verse in the
                        Bible. Typing it over and over made me realize that
                        Jesus wept because he loved Lazarus. He died for us
                        because he loves us with the same love.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        My hope is that by typing the word you will also see the
                        Bible in a deeper way.
